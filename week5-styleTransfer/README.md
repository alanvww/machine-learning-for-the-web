# Week 6 Image Transfermation - Style Transfer

## Presentation: [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QJumvGwCzErFJFva2LnqNLUmIDp_uz83fPWC6iCR3l0/edit?usp=sharing)
- What is Style Transfer
- How does it work
- What Neural Networks See
- Different kinds of style transfer
- How to train your own style transfer
- Use the trained model in ml5.js (one image and webcam images)

## Coding session:
- Training a new Style Transfer model, Run this [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TZNdhoUEBoxQqY5EFloZcuyYUs9oNQ-g?usp=sharing). Watch this [video1](https://www.loom.com/share/dc6751df8b2f4341ac6f836050850e15), [video2](https://www.loom.com/share/6bf37a744aff498ea231358e982b122d)
  - Some Notes:
    - Open the colab, make sure the GPU is enabled: Menu - Runtime - Change runtime type
    - Run through each cell, wait for each cell to finish running, make sure there is no error in each cell's output
    - Step 2 and 3 may take 1 and 2 hours to finish, keep the tab open and active while waiting(Power your computer while waiting)
    - Once step 2(download datasets) finishes, don't re-run it, becase it takes a long to finish
    - While running step 2(download dataset), it might notify you that "Disk is almost full", ignore that
